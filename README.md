<h1>Problem Intro</h1>
Datasets were given which contained detailed routes, metro-routes and bus-routes of dhaka city. The problem was to find most efficient routes
based on different criterias. A total of 6 problems were given. The problem set can be found <a href = "https://github.com/zarif98sjs/BUET_Obliviate_CodeSamurai/blob/master/Code%20Samurai%202019%20-%20Problem%20Set.pdf">
here</a>.

<h1>Details</h1>
Different versions of the Dijkstra algorithm were used to solve the various problems. We also focused on the speed and efficiency of the algorithm.
Due to the huge nature of the dataset, we converted the data into dictionaries modified to extract the exact info that were needed and these were then
saved in the Dictionaries directory. Easy and fast data extraction merged with the most efficient algorithm results in high speed output.<br>
<h3>Usage</h3>
Step 1: Run a program file of any of the Problem directory. Then input a source and a destination latitude, longtitude pair. <br>
Step 2: The program will output a kml file and a Textual desciption file.(according to the rules specified in the given problemset) <br>
Step 3: Use the kml file to get the route in Google maps or OpenStreetMap and the Textfile contains basic guidelines for the routes. <br>
Here is an example route : <br><br>
